# COA-TASKFORCE-Challenge

# UI Interactive Photo Gallery

This project is a responsive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery features hover effects, a lightbox for full-size image viewing, and navigation through thumbnails and next/previous buttons. The gallery is designed to be responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.


#Features

    1.Hover Effects:Images have a zoom-in effect with increased brightness when hovered. Text overlays with "See More" appear on hover.
    2.Lightbox: Click on any image to open a full-size view in a lightbox with next and previous buttons for navigation.
    3.Thumbnails: Thumbnails are displayed in the lightbox for quick navigation.
    4.Image Names: Each image has a name displayed below it, which slightly moves upward when the image is hovered.
    5.Responsive Design: The gallery is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile views.

**Coding Challenges**

**Challenge 1: Array Manipulation**

Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.
Example

    Input: arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
    Output: true
    Explanation: The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17, which is equal to the target.



    **Challenge 2: String Transformation**
    
Problem Statement

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

    If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
    If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
    If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.

Examples

    Input: "Hamburger"
        Output: "regrubmaH"
        Explanation: The length of the string is 9, which is divisible by 3. The string is reversed.
